# Pixirain 
## What is it
Pixirain is a flexible procedural rain generator. It was written in [PixiJS](https://www.pixijs.com/), a 2D WebGL renderer and [Howler.js](https://howlerjs.com/), an audio library which uses the Web Audio API.

## Why did I do it?
I have wanted to dip my feet into procedural generation for a long time. I had also never worked with JavaScript in a project without React.js, which I intended to change.

## Why Rain?
I like rain.

## Features
* Rain and thunder sounds can be individually turned on with full volume control
* Rain particle and Background colours can be changed along with particle transparency.
* Particle count, velocity, angle of rainfall are all fully customisable.
